Verifying sources of information is vital in assessing the credibility of facts 
and data in our increasingly digital world; often, the verification of the sources 
is as necessary as the information they provide. To battle misinformation and 
disinformation through digital objects, it is salient to provide consumers the ability 
to verify whether or not information (or data) provided by such sources was altered 
prior to its use (e.g., publication). To address these concerns, we designed and implemented
Signet-ring. Signet-ring registers and authenticates all 
participants in the origination and publication process, potentially including the sources, 
publishers, and applications. It manages the following critical workflows: (1) documentation 
and verification of the relationships between objects and sources (certification),
(2) documentation and verification of the relationships between different related objects 
(lineage), and (3) authentication of sources to each other (handshake). Furthermore, Signet-ring 
supports the lifecycle management of source identities (using cryptographic keys) and relationships 
between objects and sources. This lifecycle management includes the revocation of source identity 
keys and previously accepted object-source relationships.
