  Sensors networks are often constrained by limited power and limited
  communication range. If a sensor receives two messages simultaneously
  then they collide and both messages become incomprehensible.
  In this paper, we present a simple time division multiple access
  (TDMA) algorithm for assigning time slots to sensors and show that
  it provides a significant reduction in the number of collisions incurred
  during communication. We present TDMA algorithms customized
  for different communication patterns, namely, broadcast,
  convergecast and local gossip, that occur commonly in sensor networks.
  Our algorithms are self-stabilizing, i.e., TDMA is restored
  even if the system reaches an arbitrary state where the sensors are
  corrupted or improperly initialized.
