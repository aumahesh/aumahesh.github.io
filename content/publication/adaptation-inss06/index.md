  In this paper, we concentrate on component adaptation in sensor-actuator networks. Component adaptation is the process of dynamically replacing components in an application in response to changes in the environment conditions. Since the normal operation of a sensor-actuator network is often hindered by faults (e.g., node failures, message losses, synchronization errors), it is important that the application adapts to the given conditions by dynamically composing suitable components. On the other hand, the applications are time-critical in nature and, hence, it is necessary to ensure that the network provides the required functionalities during adaptation. In this paper, we propose an approach for component adaptation in sensor-actuator networks by systematically using the distributed reset framework that provides assurance guarantees during adaptation. And, we perform a case study on a vibration control application.
