  Project ExScal (for Extreme Scale) fielded a 1000+ node wireless sensor network and a 200+ node peer-to-peer ad hoc network of 802.11 devices in a 1.3km by 300m remote area in Florida, USA during December 2004. In comparison with previous deployments, the ExScal application is relatively complex and its networks are the largest ones of either type fielded to date. In this paper, we overview the key requirements of ExScal, the corresponding design of the hardware/software platform and application, and some results of our experiments.
