The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been felt and are still being felt around the world. In particular,
the tourism industry suffered extreme economic losses between the many travel restrictions, cessation of
communal social activities, and widespread fear of contracting the virus. Specifically, in 2020, there was a
$35\%$ reduction in domestic travel, resulting significant revenue loss. By contrast, there was an uptick in 
domestic travel in 2021. In this project, we seek to understand how vaccination rates are impacting vacation
mobility in the Pacific Northwest during summer 2021. We explore the relationship between number of trips between
100 and 500 miles and COVID-19 vaccinations controlled for key related attributes, including population
density and number of COVID-19 cases. In addition, we also consider several additional factors that influence
travel, such as employment status, state restrictions, and political ideology. We also note that this study only
focuses on a small time period -July 4th weekend.
