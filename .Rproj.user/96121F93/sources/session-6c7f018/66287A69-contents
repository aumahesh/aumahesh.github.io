Air travel has a significant role in shaping economies of states and this it is important to optimize every
aspect of the flight cycle to increase the quality of airline's services, especially, the consistent on-time
departure of flights. However, due to multiple factors, airline flight delay is inevitable, and thus have to be
accounted for by the airline company executives in order to optimize value to multiple stakeholders --from the
shareholders to the customers.  In this project, we seek to address the following question: can weather and
airline data collected two hours before the scheduled departure time, predict whether the flight will be 
delayed 15 minutes or more? The models we developed in this project, predict the delay with an accuracy of $82\%$.
