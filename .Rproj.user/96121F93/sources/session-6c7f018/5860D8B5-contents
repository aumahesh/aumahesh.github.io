Much like cursive writing in English, the Japanese language has Kuzushiji, roughly translating to squished writing. 
This writing style was used for over a thousand years beginning in the 8th century but is not taught in modern day curricula. 
As a result, most Japanese natives, aside from a select few experts, can read Kuzushiji. Most conversion of these works from 
Kuzushiji to modern Japanese is done by hand and takes countless hours for just a single document. However, with the 
relatively recent effort by museums and libraries to digitize ancient works in an effort to safeguard these priceless artifacts against natural disasters, the use of AI for these conversions has become suddenly more realistic. This project looks to build on existing work to restore deteriorated ancient texts through the use of generative AI such as GANs or the more advanced Diffusion Models. Converting these works into modern legible Japanese can help better understand, as well as preserve the history and culture of the Japanese people.
