Connectors bring in telemetry and
analytics data from various vantage points in a data center. Typical connectors
include network switches and routers, application delivery controllers such as
F5 Big-IP and Citrix NetScaler, and firewalls. Tetration uses the data
collected from such connectors to baseline the behavior in a network and
automatically organize the workloads in the data center. In addition, Tetration
also recommends Zero-Trust policies and enforces them. As part of this project,
I designed and developed a framework for the lifecycle management of connector
integration, including: (i) creation of the connector integration, (ii)
configuration management of the connectors, and (iii) troubleshooting
infrastructure.
