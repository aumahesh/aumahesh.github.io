This writing style was used for over a thousand years beginning in the 8th century but is not taught in modern day curricula. As a result, most Japanese natives, aside from a select few experts, can read Kuzushiji. Most conversion of these works from Kuzushiji to modern Japanese is done by hand and takes countless hours for just a single document. However, with the relatively recent effort by museums and libraries to digitize ancient works in an effort to safeguard these priceless artifacts against natural disasters, the use of AI for these conversions has become suddenly more realistic. This project looks to build on existing work to restore deteriorated ancient texts through the use of generative AI such as GANs or the more advanced Diffusion Models. Converting these works into modern legible Japanese can help better understand, as well as preserve the history and culture of the Japanese people.\n","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"47029d398a23f39fd071d6f16440628d","permalink":"/project/capstone-mids/","publishdate":"2023-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/capstone-mids/","section":"project","summary":"This project looks to build on existing work to restore deteriorated ancient texts through the use of optical character recognition and generative AI such as GANs or the more advanced Diffusion Models.","tags":["Machine Learning","Data Science","LLM","MIDS"],"title":"Restor-AI-tion: Ancient Handwritten Japanese Texts Restoration","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mahesh Arumugam","Catherine Jimerson","Diamond Rorie","Amangeet Samra","Amrita Mande","Daniel Aranki"],"categories":null,"content":"Verifying sources of information is vital in assessing the credibility of facts and data in our increasingly digital world; often, the verification of the sources is as necessary as the information they provide.To battle misinformation and disinformation through digital objects, it is salient to provide consumers the ability to verify whether or not information (or data) provided by such sources was altered prior to its use (e.g., publication). Furthermore, if such an object is altered, it would also be essential to provide a means to trace back such information throughout its editing lineage in a verifiable manner.This research aims to fill the gaps in verifiable proof of sources of information, software supply-chain, and objects in other similarly critical domains.\nWe propose Signet-ring, a framework that provides referenceable documentation of the relationship between a digital object and its sources. In addition, the framework documents the object’s lifetime as it goes through various edits (lineage), including those by others within the framework. As such, Signet-ring provides a verifiable means for anyone to authenticate the sources of any digital object registered to it and track the object’s progression in time. This framework can be used, for example, by journalists and publishers to verify the sources of their materials (e.g., videos or images) and provide this proof to their readers for their verification. This, in turn, introduces a new layer of trust to the public in the reporting they consume.\nAnother noteworthy use case for Signet-ring is aiding the assurance process in software supply chains. The various stages and components of software can be certified using Signet-ring to provide verifiable checkpoints of revisions that pass assurance guarantees. For example, consider a program or a change-list (e.g., a pull request) that one person authentically creates and registers within Signet-ring. Suppose this code becomes visible, and any third-party modifications (not authenticated by the framework) are available. Then, only the change within the framework will have a traceable relationship to the source and its lineage. Thus, the framework enables various stakeholders to verify the relationship between sources and software objects, including changes made to revisions of software with certified assurances.\nIn this presentation, we present the architecture of the Signet-ring. signet-ring registers and authenticates all participants in the origination and publication process, potentially including the sources, publishers, and applications. It manages the following critical workflows:\ndocumentation and verification of the relationships between objects and sources (certification), documentation and verification of the relationships between different related objects (lineage), and authentication of sources to each other (handshake). Furthermore, Signet-ring supports the lifecycle management of source identities (using cryptographic keys) and relationships between objects and sources. This lifecycle management includes the revocation of source identity keys and previously accepted object-source relationships.\n","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"2baa982e50828c5d500992b6d2879779","permalink":"/publication/signet-ring-hcss23/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/signet-ring-hcss23/","section":"publication","summary":"A framework for authenticatin sources and lineages of digital objects.","tags":[],"title":"Signet-ring: A framework for authenticating sources and lineages of digital objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project, we investigate the urban land use dataset from UC Merced that consists of 21 land use categories from various urban areas across the United States.

Towards this end, we propose CodeT5++, extensions to CodeT5 where we introduce novel pre-training tasks that capture relevant source code features most useful in code summarization tasks. Specifically, we pretrain the model to (1) predict masked return values of Python functions, (2) detect whether a docstring and source code pair is an accurate representation of the function, and (3) predict masked function names of Python functions.Subsequently, we fine-tune the models for the code summarization task and evaluate the performance using a smoothed BLEU-4 score, a precision-based metric applicable in translation tasks.
