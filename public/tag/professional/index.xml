      <title>Lifecycle management of Tetration Connectors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Connectors bring in telemetry and
analytics data from various vantage points in a data center. Typical connectors
include network switches and routers, application delivery controllers such as
F5 Big-IP and Citrix NetScaler, and firewalls. Tetration uses the data
collected from such connectors to baseline the behavior in a network and
automatically organize the workloads in the data center. In addition, Tetration
also recommends Zero-Trust policies and enforces them. As part of this project,
I designed and developed a framework for the lifecycle management of connector
integration, including: (i) creation of the connector integration, (ii)
configuration management of the connectors, and (iii) troubleshooting
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>StyleBooks: A declarative configuration language for Citrix ADC</title>
      <link>/project/stylebooks-citrix/</link>

      <guid>/project/stylebooks-citrix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;StyleBooks is a declarative
language that allow users to consume NetScaler (now, called Citrix ADC)
services in a variety of data center configurations and cloud
architectures, providing both configuration simplification and smart
operational visibility. It captures useful NetScaler configuration and
includes operational aspects (health, counters, logs). New StyleBooks can be
created by cloning and modifying existing ones, or by composing existing
StyleBooks into new ones, thus, allowing for modular and incremental design.
In this project, I was responsible for the following: (i) compiler for
StyleBooks that generates an equivalent Python package, (ii) design of the
runtime engine that instantiates a compiled StyleBook to create an actual
configuration, (iii) design of config audit and config diffs for computing the
differences when an existing configuration is updated, (iv) design of the
REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distributed hash table for Cluster of Citrix ADCs</title>
      <link>/project/dht-citrix/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/dht-citrix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHT provides a key-value store
for NetScaler (now, called Citrix ADC) packet engines to store application
state in multiple cores of a node or across multiple nodes/cores in a cluster.
DHT provides eventual consistency semantics to the applications. In this
project, I was responsible for the following: (i) reliable replication of
entries across the nodes, (ii) dealing with nodes joining/leaving (transitional
period) the cluster, (iii) hunting for existing key-value entry in the cluster
during transitional period.&lt;/p&gt;
